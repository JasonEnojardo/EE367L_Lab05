4.1 Improvement 1: File transfers
The currently host nodes can upload files to another host node, but the files must be at most 100 bytes. Improve the
upload so that it can transfer files of at most 1000 bytes. Use the same packet format as before, but you will have to
break up a large file into multiple packets. The packets are transferred and reassembled at the destination host. You
may specify and use other types of packets but the payload must be no more than 100 bytes.
Also implement a file download from another host, where a file can have up to 1000 bytes. For this operation, a host
will request a download of a file from another host, and provide the file name. The destination node will either transfer
the file to the requesting host or indicate it has no such file in its current directory.
